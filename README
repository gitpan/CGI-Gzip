CGI::Gzip

WARNING: as of v0.01 this is still alpha-quality code.  While it seems
to run just fine for simple standalone scripts, it breaks under
mod_perl.  Hopefully I can remove this message soon.  :-)

This module extends the CGI infrastructure to compresses output,
whenever possible.  It uses IO::Zlib (a filehandle wrapper around the
C zlib library).  If this is missing, the functionality degrades to
the typical CGI behavior.  The programmer can selectively enable or
disable the compression functionality at will.  This module does not
rely on any particular server setup.  It should work anywhere that
CGI.pm works.

Apache mod_perl users may prefer the more straightforward
implementation offered by the Apache::Compress or Apache::GzipChain
modules.

Install via the usual:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
